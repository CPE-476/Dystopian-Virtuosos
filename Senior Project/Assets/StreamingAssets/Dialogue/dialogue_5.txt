# Version FINAL

DOLCE: Great job, you two! I told you it would work.
VENTO: I practically had to shove my way in, though! Bronte was hogging that whole first wave.
BRONTE: What’s your deal, kid?! What do you have against me? We got our instruments to play in tandem, what more do you want?
VENTO: You think you’re the only one who's had to struggle in their life, but guess what? I’ve been there too! 
VENTO: Your whole lone-wolf facade — I’m so tired of it! Get out of your own head! I’m sure you would agree, we’d all rather die than go back to that nowhere planet we were unlucky enough to call home.
BRONTE: Vento...
DOLCE: Hold on, Vento, you’re bleeding! I need you to calm down and—
VENTO: Ha! If I didn’t fight alongside Bronte, we’d all be dead! We’d all be dead…
DOLCE: Vento’s losing consciousness! We need to get him back into the ship and get him an elixir!
RUMBLE. RUMBLE.
BRONTE: What is that?
DOLCE: It’s…a knight? Looks like it’s a contract soldier hired from Galaxy X, with Model DBSY 4.0 machinery.
BRONTE: Meaning?
DOLCE: In layman's terms, this thing is out-of-this-world strong!
BRONTE: I can’t reach Vento! It’s taking him hostage!
DOLCE: He's gone... Then, it’s just the two of us.
DOLCE: Vento's a hothead, but we've got to save him if we want a chance to get off this planet. Bronte, will you fight with me?
BRONTE: ...Yeah. Yeah, okay, I…we can fight this knight!
