# Version FINAL

WARNING. WARNING. TRESPASSING PLANET. TURN AROUND YOUR SHIP NOW OR WE WILL ENGAGE IN COMBAT.
VENTO: This planet's got an expensive security system!!
BRONTE: You think?? Get our escape pods ready! And send a transmission to Captain, NOW!
VENTO: You really don’t know how to ask nicely, huh? What, you can’t do anything without Cappy’s permission?
BRONTE: This is NOT the time!
DOLCE: Both of you are useless! Move out of the way!...Looks like Captain’s sent us something through the Teleportation Port. His transmission reads, “S.O.S. …CRASHED AT 35.3050° N, 120.6625° W AND FOUND WEAPONS…ONLY WAY TO DEFEAT THEM”
VENTO: Incoming enemies! A whole army of ‘em—seems to me that they’re all robots, or skilled fighters, probably hired from all over the galaxy. We’re surrounded!
DOLCE: They’re attacking in some sort of pattern, l-like a rhythm? It’s some complex musical pattern! Makes sense, considering Wisteria is the land of music and everything. I can only hold them off for so long with our ship’s lasers, and our machinery’s destroyed...
DOLCE: What are we going to do? We're out of parts to make repairs with... Oh, and we’ll also have to worry about cushioning the crash...
BRONTE: Panicking won’t solve our problems, Dolce! You heard the message, didn’t you? Captain gave us a ticket out of this so we can save him! Hand over the weapons! I’ll take the lead.
DOLCE: Fine! Just don't forget about the ship's repairs, we'll need to pick up as many spare parts and screws as we can!
BRONTE: It’s a drum hammer weapon. Hm…perfect, this way, I can beat the living crap out of these robots. I'll go first.
VENTO: Fine by me, you'll be a punching bag for those enemies.
BRONTE: “Punching Bag”, huh? Watch this, I’m going to tear ‘em up, beat by beat!
