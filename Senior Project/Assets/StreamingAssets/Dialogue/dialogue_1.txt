# Version 1

BRONTE: Calling in Captain Nova... Captain, do you copy?
*static*
BRONTE: ...Captain?
VENTO: Damn it! We've lost him. Can't get any signal out here! 
BRONTE: We'll need to meet him there. Dolce, set the ship coordinates to Planet F Major.
DOLCE: 'Please'?
VENTO: Alright you two, we don't have time for bickering. Were you not listening to what Captain said?
VENTO: We're gonna need to flank the west side of the Planet Fanel and shoot down any defenses there ASAP, remember?
VENTO: So, point being, we can't afford you both to mess things up.
VENTO: And I'm hungry so we better get there soon, because I need me a nice, juicy beetle pickles burger! Ah, I can almost taste it now!
BRONTE: Don't get it all mixed up, punk. I'm not even sure why I'm stuck with you fools.
BRONTE: You'll just get in the way - I was fine to steal the Dolce shit on my own.
DOLCE: Hmph. Really? 
BRONTE: Don't you dare scoff at me, you arrogant little-
DOLCE: I'm just being practical. There's no way you'd be able to execute the mission alone. It's much more than just 'stealing' the potion.
DOLCE: Acquiring the potions securely and smuggling it back through the homelandâ€™s security? That takes much more than a half-wit like you could do.
BRONTE: 'Half-wit'?! You-
VENTO: STOP!! Do you hear that?
