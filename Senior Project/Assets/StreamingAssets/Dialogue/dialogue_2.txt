# Version FINAL

VENTO: Bronte! We’ve fixed one of the laser cannons with those parts you collected, but the enemies keep coming! 
BRONTE: I can handle it, keep manning the ship!
DOLCE: No, you can’t. See the next wave of fighters? Their attacks sound like some sort of resonance. 
DOLCE: They’re just going to hit you every second you’re still recovering from you last hammer strike. Let me try.
BRONTE: What? What weapon are you going to use?
DOLCE: The piano, what else?
VENTO: Dolce’s got a point. Stand down, Bronte!
BRONTE: Whatever. I bet you won’t be able to destroy half as many of 'em.
DOLCE: I’ll take that bet.
