# Version FINAL

VENTO: Who’s bright idea was it to rescue Captain again? ‘Course it was yours, Bronte! Always kissing up to him...
VENTO: Face it, he’s probably long gone now! I can't believe we’re stranded on Wisteria!
VENTO: I’d much rather be back at the capital, beetle pickles burger in hand, sippin’ a glass of Coolant… ah, that’s the life!
BRONTE: All you do is complain! Don’t you feel that? It’s like the planet has a heart that’s beating and we’re getting closer to it. 
BRONTE: Captain didn’t bring us down here for nothing, and if you don't want to find out what's down there, I could care less.
VENTO: Man, just listen to yourself! It’s always, “Captain this, Captain that,” blah, blah, blah.
DOLCE: Vento, listen, you have to calm down. Again, I have a bad feeling about this, but we have to work together or we're done for. 
DOLCE: You saw how we utilize these weapons – we need to be more effective. Bronte, your instrument was worthless when that second wave of enemies came along. You needed my help.
DOLCE: There must be a way to enhance our combat capabilities if we switch in to fill eachother's weaknesses. Come on, Bronte, we have to stick together.
BRONTE: I don’t need anyone, never did, never will. Now that we’re no longer in a crashing ship, I’m more than happy to dismiss you two and drop you morons off wherever you wish. It would be my pleasure.
WARNING. WARNING. UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS CLOSING IN.
DOLCE: Well, you'll have to have a change of heart, and make it quick: looks like this path is heavily guarded, and from the radar, some of these guys look massive!
BRONTE: I’ll move to ground level and handle it!
VENTO: Oh, no, you don’t! I’m stepping in!
DOLCE: I’ll take control of the ship in the meantime, we can’t afford any more damage to it than what we already have!
DOLCE: Just... try to work together down there, or else we're finished!
