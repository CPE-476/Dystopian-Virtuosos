# Version 1

Casari.
A vast land devastated by those who'd taken advantage of the fruit it bore.
Resources thinning, even the beggars slowly trickling away from the streets, left to die.
A planet eating itself inside out until nothing more than a desolate husk remained in its people's wake.
---
Greed so cancerous that life itself could only sustain itself by stealing away the livelihood of others-
in a way that only the man-made devices that fed into the people's self-destruction could thrive.
A never-ending cycle, a story we know all too well, unfolding in a place like this, in a galaxy much too far from our own.
---
Bronte wasn't going to let that happen. 
Bronte's homeland was running dry, being sucked of all resources.
But most importantly, the Dolce Elixir, their lifesource, the potion that cures all ailments and even ran through all of their power plants had become a scarce commodity.
Without it, they all were dying, or at least, the small number of the living-both organic and artificial-residing on Casari.
In attempts to save their planet, an unlikely team of 3, brought together for the warring efforts of their planet, set off through the cosmos in search for the elixir.
